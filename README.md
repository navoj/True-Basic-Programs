# True Basic Programs
Here is a store of programs that I wrote in middle school in the True Basic language.

The Coloring Page is a simple paint program.

Starry Night is the beginning of a story that I was writing in True Basic, but never finished.

Multiplayer is a game where up to 3 players can compete to eat as many fruits as possible without running into any black holes. True Basic can only register one key press at a time, so when more than one player plays, the players have to bash to keys to move.
